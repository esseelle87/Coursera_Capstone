    "\n",
    "In this project, we will investigate the trends in the housing rental market of the city of \n",
    "Geneva, Switzerland. Our customers will be newcomers looking for advice on renting an apartment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Switzerland is among the richest countries in the world. According to a 2018 study by the Swiss financial institution UBS <a href=\"https://www.ubs.com/microsites/prices-earnings/en/\" target=\"_top\">on the most expensive cities in the world</a>, Geneva and Zurich, both in Switzerland, ranked as the top two. The high cost of life in these cities is normally compensated by the high average salaries paid by employers. However, optimizing expenses still plays a key role in people’s well-beings because rental costs remains high in Geneva. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, rent is typically the single largest cost for most people. That is why optimizing one’s monthly rent is crucial to improving budget management. Optimizing in this context means answering 2 key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which are the features that influence the price of a house the most?\n",
    "* Are there external factors determining the price difference between properties with nominally identical features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, there are obvious factors that influence the market value of a residential property directly, e.g. the surface area, or number of rooms. The influence of these kind of features on the rent will be carried out quantitatively. In some cases, two seemingly identical properties could have sensibly different prices. There could be several reasons for this, namely the more expensive property could be surrounded by better services. Or it could simply be in a more prestigious neighborhood. Other reasons could be that the less expensive property has been out of the market for an extended period of the time and avoided the price rise that lead to its current expected price. \n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these questions will help our customers better understand what they are really paying for. Whether it is extra space or better accessibility to certain services, these informations will enable customers to make more educated choices and find the apartments that suits them best. \n"

    "A large part of the housing market in Geneva can be found online through rental listing websites, which offers arguably the best visibility on the market.

    "* We searched for all the currently available properties within a 5km radius around Geneva (this also includes properties in nearby towns).\n",

    "* We extracted a number of key features that we considered to be useful for our later on study: \n",
    "    * 'cityName': city were the property is located. \n",
    "    * 'extraPrice': price of some utilities, e.g. heating (in CHF).\n",
    "    * 'price': the total price of the rent, including 'extraPrice' (in CHF).\n",
    "    * 'latitude': the latitued of the property.\n",
    "    * 'longitude': the longitude of the property.\n",
    "    * 'numberOfRooms': the number of rooms in the property.\n",
    "    * 'street': the address of the property. \n",
    "    * 'surfaceLiving': the area of the property (in sqm).\n",
    "    * 'zip': the postal code associated with the property.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* We checked the integrity of the data and found out that certain key features, e.g. price, or surface area, were missing for some items. We then decided to drop all entries with missing key features: numberOfRooms, surfaceLiving, and price. \n",

    "* We converted the type of each column to a more suitable type (e.g. 'zip' should be an integer), as by default, each feature was set to be an 'object' type.\n",

    "### Price driving key features.\n",
    "The starting point of our analysis is identifying the key features that influence the most the price of the properties in our database, and describing the relationship quantitatively. We do this by generating plots of the collected properties prices vs. feature. We will focus on: i) 'zip': to look for correlations between prices and neighborhoods; ii) 'numberOfRooms' and 'surfaceLiving', as we expect the size of a property to be key feature for determining its price.\n",

    "##### Price vs zip\n",
    "A boxplot representation of 'price' vs 'zip' (top-left panel, figure below) reveals a fairly large variation in the prices of properties sharing the same postal codes, compared to the distribution of prices among different postal coded regions. The 'pricePerSqm'(top-right panel, figure below) also appears to be homogeneous, implying that overall, no neighborhood is evidently more expensive then the other. An exception could be the 1216 postal code, which appears to have\n",
    "a significantly larger 'pricePerSqm'. However, here the explanation lies in the fact that the 'pricePerSqm' is significantly higher for smaller properties (bottom-left panel, figure below) and most of the properties associated with this postal code have indeed low 'surfaceLiving' values (bottom-right panel, figure below), which explains the apparently larger 'pricePerSqm'. With the present sample size, it is not possible to establish whether the observed abundance of smaller properties in this neighborhood is an intrinsic feature or a momentary occurrence. Therefore, it is safer to assume an homogeneity in the 'pricePerSqm' distribution across all neighborhoods.\n",
